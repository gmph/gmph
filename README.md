### I'm a Product Designer at Facebook in London, designing tools to make life a little bit easier for the people behind small businesses.

I enjoy the problem solving involved in all aspects of creating useful, usable digital products, and have the ability to work as a generalist across design, research, product management, analytics and software engineering.

In my free time, I build little apps independently (like [Your Week](https://yourweek.app/), [Shout](https://shoutgif.com/), [Timeline](https://timeline.grahammacphee.com/) and [HRU](https://hru.chat/)), take [photos](https://instagram.com/gmph), and write about design and mental health.
