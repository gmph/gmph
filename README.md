### Hi! I'm Graham Macphee. I'm a Product Designer at WhatsApp, based in London.

At WhatsApp, I'm currently focusing on making media and file sharing simple and expressive. Previously at Meta, I designed experiences in Messenger, Facebook and Workplace.

In my free time, I build little apps independently (like [Your Week](https://yourweek.app/), [Shout](https://shoutgif.com/), [Timeline](https://timeline.grahammacphee.com/) and [HRU](https://hru.chat/)), take [photos](https://instagram.com/gmph). I also work with startups to kick-start their product development.
